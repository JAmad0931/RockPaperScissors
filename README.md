# RockPaperScissors
May, 2023 Personal Project:

The goal was to create a personal project on my own in order to better understand the skills learned in my Web Programming course. Therefore, I went with a simpler project of creating rock, paper, scissors game. 

The end product was to have a player be able to play against a bot/AI and allowing the player to choose between three options along with having the score be kept up with whether it was a draw, a win, or a loss.
